# AI Club Learning Objectives - Spring 2020

Weekly meetings will include a coding session, where all members work through an applied machine learning model in Jupyter Notebooks to solve an isolated problem.

Members will work through **three solutions each month** focused on a specific subfield of machine intelligence. At the end of each month, the club will use these skills to produce a competitive solution for a Kaggle coding competition. 

## **Goals:**
1. Learning begins with the **application** of machine learning, moving backwards to the **technology**, then the **theory**.
2. All coding sessions will be created in an **agnostic environment**.
3. **Summarized** practice in all subfields of applied AI.  
4. Learn and develop solutions **collaboratively**.

---

## **Process**:

### Weekly:
1. Begin with an existing Jupyter Notebook implementing the target technology.
    - Notebook will contain:
        - Explicit model architecture
        - Internal dataset loading
    - With the following qualities:
        - Minimal compilation (<2m)
        - Fast model training (<7m)
        - Simple visualization of results using common packages like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
2. After the session, further study resources will be provided on the technology, including:
    - Jupyter Notebook used
    - Dataset source and state-of-the art preformance metrics on leading model architectures
3. The session will end with a group review:
    - Session assessment on:
        - Enjoyment
        - Applicability
        - Novelty
    - Plans for future sessions:
        - Datasets to cover
        - Model architectures
        - Modern technologies to cover

### Monthly
1. Meet and discuss the kaggle competition.
2. Discuss the data and prepare collaborative environment.
3. Work through solutions in and out of meeting time, with potential auxiliary sessions to refine and publish our solution!

## **Progression Schedule:**

Each month will cover a subfield of AI, and end with a related competition. These fields are subject to change, and open to reccomendation.
