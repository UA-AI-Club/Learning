# UA AI Club - Knowledgebase

Resources for topics covered in weekly machine learning lessons for the University of Alabama Artificial Intelligence club.

---

## Topics

Topics are selected weekly by club officers, or by vote in meetings. If there's an interesting topic that hasn't been covered yet, send an email to the contacts at the bottom of the readme or join our slack channel. 

Each topic has a folder with the following three pieces of content.

### Lessons
This is the slideshow used to present the topic to the club during weekly meetings. Includes some graphics, intuition, and motivation for higher-level understanding about each subject. 

### Resources
To further research a topic that may be of greater interest, we've included some coursera, Youtube, and paper links. Feel free to reccomend some additional resources.  

### Notebooks
For a better understanding of the Python implementation, we're hoping to get a browser-executable Jupyter Notebook for each lesson. Jupyter Notebook setup documentation coming soon.
